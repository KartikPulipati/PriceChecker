# PriceChecker
Check Prices with Amazon, Walmart, and Target
By: Kartik

This is a Django Project that uses an API to get the prices of a product from Amazon, Walmart and Target!

If you want to try this out you need your own API Key, get those from here:
Walmart: https://www.bluecartapi.com/
Amazon: https://www.rainforestapi.com/
Target: https://rapidapi.com/logicbuilder/api/target-com-store-product-reviews-locations-data?

Then insert the API key in corresponding areas in check/views.py

Happy Coding!
